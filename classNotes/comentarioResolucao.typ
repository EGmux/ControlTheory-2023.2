#set heading(numbering:  "1.")
=  Poles and stability
===  Every single  pole in  left semi plane  $->$  stable

===  Any pole in  imaginary  axis with 1 multiplicity $->$  partially stable

===  Any pole  in  right semi plane/  pole in imaginary axis/  higher multiplicity than 1 $->$  unstable

=  Good practices
===  Place every repeatable element in a line
#line(length: 100%)
